    Some random shots for our field work. I wanna highlight the third picture, we thought that we have got good photos for the herbivorous activities engaged by crabs, instead we got something almost the otherwise! I think this implicate the obsurity of their diet, and good example of previously wrong assumption of them being obligately herbivorous.

    Highlights for the published first part of my thesis, focusing on the gut metagenome taxonomic and functional profiles. Left links the bacterial phyla with their function (orange Actinobacteria highly associated with herbivorous crabs). Middle one shows the Principal Coordinate Analysis of the bacterial function and makeup, demonstrating close gut microbiome functions association with diet. The right demonstrates the same results of higher abundance of plant lignocellulose digestive enzymes in Herbivorous crabs.

    Some major finding of the second part of the thesis about host expression of lignocellulolytic genes, which is in preparation for publication. Left shows the high quality of transcriptome assembled, and right shows the higher relative expression in herbivorous species compared to those with other diets. Ongoing works also on
