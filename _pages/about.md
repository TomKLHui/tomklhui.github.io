Hello,

I am Tom Kwok Lun Hui, a dedicated and enthusiastic researcher specializing in molecular ecology. My academic journey includes obtaining an MPhil in Biology and a BSc (Hons) in Biology from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I delved into the fascinating realm of molecular ecology, particularly focusing on metagenomic and transcriptomic studies related to digestive functions in herbivorous crab holobionts.

My research experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set, from conducting field collections and dissections of intertidal animals to proficiently handling nucleic acid extractions on challenging samples. Additionally, my expertise extends to molecular techniques such as PCR, cloning, and protein expression, complemented by my proficiency in data analysis tools like R, Python, and various omics tools.

Noteworthy projects during my academic tenure include my thesis work, which explored novel microscopic aspects influencing the macroevolution of crabs on land, leading to publications in esteemed international journalsm which you can easily find (EVERYWHERE) in this website.

Beyond academia, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with others. As a Teaching Assistant at the CUHK Summer Institute and through volunteer work at events like the Hong Kong Black Kite Festival and Reef Check, I have contributed to spreading scientific awareness and fostering environmental education.

Thank you for you interest in my profile! I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you.
